                        <hr class="special mb-5">
						<p>Here are some insider tips and tricks about how to best monitor your blood sugar levels:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Be clear about what your goals are</li>
							<p>There is no point in monitoring if you don’t understand what your target range is. Work with your diabetes care team to make sure your goals are meaningful, measurable and realistic. They should be related to things you have direct control over – such as when/how often you will check, record and review your glucose levels.</p>
							<li>Stay organized</li>
							<p>Logging every reading into Droobi is an easy way of keeping track of all your readings without needing to write anything down. This will help you find meaningful trends from your readings directly from your phone.  Glucose values by themselves may reveal when we are in and out of range. There is always a context, or story, behind each reading. Keeping track of your food and activity, as they both affect your glucose levels, can help you and your health coach find reasons behind out of range readings. </p>
							<li>Learn from your information</li>
							<p>After a few weeks of tracked blood sugar readings, chat with your health coach to spot any trends. Review the blood sugar values at each phase of the day separately: pre-breakfast, post-breakfast, pre-lunch, etc. </p>
							<li>Make it easy to check your blood sugar</li>
							<p>Some people like to have an extra meter (or two) so that they don’t have to carry it to and from work, kitchen/bedroom, up/ downstairs, etc. Also, try these tips to make it as painless as possible:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Choose a meter that requires a very small blood sample (0.5 microliters or less, if possible)</li>
								<li>Use the thinnest lancets possible and change them regularly </li>
								<li>Use a lancing device that has an adjustable tip, and set it for the lowest setting that still produces a sufficient blood drop </li>
								<li>Prick the sides of the fingers rather than the tips, and “milk” the finger after pricking </li>
								<li>Use the 3rd (middle), 4th (ring) and 5th (pinky) fingers on each hand and rotate your sites </li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
