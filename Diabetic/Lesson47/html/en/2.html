                        <hr class="special mb-5">
						<p>Tala was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after having gestational diabetes during her pregnancy. Tala has always struggled with her weight. Before pregnancy, she tried so many different diets and lost weight, but always gained it back. High blood pressure also runs in her family, so when she was diagnosed with diabetes, it was a wakeup call that things need to change. </p>
						<p>Instead of trying a specific diet, Tala’s approach this time around is to make healthy choices whenever she can and try to move more during the day. She focused on having more whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Some meals Tala enjoyed were grilled chicken with sautéed spinach and tabbouleh. She started eating more slowly to help her eat smaller portions. Instead of starting a high intensity program, Tala committed to walking for at least 30 minutes every day.</p>
						<p>Over a few weeks, the pounds came off. Tala’s blood sugar levels also improved. Her doctor lessened her medication dosage because of all the progress Tala has made.</p>
