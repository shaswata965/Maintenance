                        <hr class="special mb-5">
						<p>If your family members are less supportive, it can be discouraging to continue eating healthy and exercising. It is more difficult to choose healthier options if your loved ones are having high-fat and high-sugar foods around. </p>
						<p>Just know that it might not be their intention to slow down your progress. Maybe your partner just wants to celebrate your promotion with cake. </p>
						<p>Here’s how to cope with unsupportive family members:</p>
						<ul type="square">
							<li><strong>Make a statement. </strong>Break it down to your family members how their actions are making you feel. They may not know that bringing unhealthy foods home makes it harder for you to stick to your healthy eating plan. Kindly ask them to eat tempting foods when you’re not around.</li>
							<li><strong>Keep triggers out of sight.  </strong>You’re less likely to slip up if the temptation is not in sight. This doesn’t mean hiding your family’s unhealthy food from them. Just make sure that you can’t see it. </li>
							<li><strong>Make smart substitutions. </strong>If there are sugary treats around, it would be worth your time to learn about how to make a healthier version of the recipe. This is especially important if you are the person preparing these treats. Here are some healthy substitutions you can try:</li>
							<p>Sugar = natural non-sugary sweeteners (Stevia)<br>Cream cheese = low fat cottage cream cheese<br>White flour = whole-wheat or almond flour<br>Butter = apple sauce</p>
							<li><strong>Share your ideas. </strong>Instead of proposing typical diet foods like salads, start with small substitutions to the dishes your family loves. For example, using low-fat cheese and adding more vegetables than meat to your lasagna can save you on calories and fat without sacrificing flavor. If you don’t have control over the food being cooked, try making it yourself and see if they can tell the difference. </li>
							<li><strong>Stay firm. </strong>For some people, it’s what people say that affects them more than what they eat. You might have people in your life who will say comments like “I prefer you heavier” or “you look better with more weight on”. Many people who are trying to lose weight suffer from low self-esteem, which makes it even more difficult to lose weight when you hear these comments. This is the time to get honest with your loved ones. Find out what is triggering negative comments. When someone starts to lose weight and improve their appearance, it can make others feel threatened or scared about this new change. Talk to them about the focus on health, not appearance. </li>
							<li><strong>Involve them in rewards. </strong>If you reach your 2 kg weight loss goal, tell your loved ones that they can celebrate this achievement with you by going out for a long weekend vacation or buying a new piece of furniture for the house. </li>
						</ul>
